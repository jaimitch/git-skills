    <h1>Jaren Mitchell</h1>
    <p>I am born and raised in Charleston, SC.
    Before I started coding I was an Administrative Assistant,
    most recently for Charleston County DSS Legal Department.
    I choose coding because I needed a career change and I wanted to work in
    a field with more growth potential.</p>
